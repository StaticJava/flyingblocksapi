### Supported Versions

As this plugin uses submodules, you can use the same plugin JAR for different Minecraft versions despite the frequent relocations of the NMS/OBC classes. Currently, this includes the versions

* 1_6_R3 (1.6.4)
* 1_7_R1 (1.7.0 - 1.7.2)
* 1_7_R2 (1.7.5)

Commands & Permissions
----------------------

* */flyingblocks-removeall* - Removes all flying blocks from the worlds. Good for debugging.
  `flyingblocks.removeall` (OP by default)
* */flyingblocks-examples* - Lists all commands of the examples, check them out! :P *Note:* Most of the examples depend on world ticks (day/night cycle needs to be running)
  `flyingblocks.examples` (OP by default)

Building
--------

This plugin uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) as build tool. Just [download](https://github.com/ase34/flyingblocksapi/archive/master.zip) this repositotry's zipfile or clone it via Git using `git clone http://github.com/ase34/flyingblocksapi.git`, then invoke `mvn clean package` to build a new JAR file.

Underlying Technique
--------------------

This technique is heavily inspired by [The Holographic Displays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1B19JvX5TE) of [Asdjke](http://www.youtube.com/user/AsdjkeAndBro). Without his ideas and research, this plugin would likely never been made. Thanks. This should give you an abstract explanation how this plugin achieves its behavior:

* First, a *Wither Skull* will be spawned about 100 blocks above the block's desired spawnpoint.
  That skull is not affected by gravity at the client, so there is *no* constant downfall-cancellation (for example, using packets) needed.
* Then, a *Horse* is attached to the skull with an age of -4057200. The extremely low age causes the client to render the horse as invisible, but also setting the position of their passengers around 100 block below the horse.
* Finally, a *Falling Sand Block* with a different block id is attached to the horse. Because of the age of the horse and the height of the skull, the block appears a the exact spawn position. The falling block is not affected by gravity on the client because it is an (indirect) passenger of the skull.

API Usage
---------

### Adding to build path

In order to use the API, you need to add *flyingblocksapi* to your plugin's build path. If you are not using Maven or comparable, you actually do the same thing like with your `craftbukkit.jar` or `bukkit.jar`. For Maven users, I provide a public repository on this GitHub project page. Just add these bits of markup in your pom.xml:

```
...
<repositories>
  <!-- Bukkit repo -->
  ...
  <repository>
    <id>ase34-repo</id>
    <url>http://ase34.github.io/maven-repo</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
...
<dependencies>
  <!-- more depenencies -->
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>de.ase34</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyingblocksapi</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
```

Then, don't forget to add `depend: [flyingblocksapi]` to your *plugin.yml*.

### Implement own movement logic

Using the API as a developer is quite easy, he/she just has to extend the class [de.ase34.flyingblocksapi.FlyingBlock](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html) and override the [onTick()](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html#onTick()) method by his own movement logic. In the method body, some special rules need to be follown:

* Due to a misimplementation/bug/whatever **`getBukkitEntity().teleport(Location)` does fail for entities** with a passenger attached. *flyingblocksapi* provides an **alternative by invoking [setLocation(Location)](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html#setLocation(org.bukkit.Location))**. You might use [setBlockLocation(Location)](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html#setBlockLocation(org.bukkit.Location)) to **set the location of the block's center** and not of the skull (If you are *not* using default parameters for horse age and height offset, this might not work).
* In order to **set the velocity/direction/movement of the skull** using the Bukkit API, please **use `setVelocity(Vector)` and *not* `setDirection(Vector)`**.
* Please keep in mind that you **are modifying the skull entity, not the falling block**. The skull is normally located 100 blocks higher than the appearance of the block. (See [getHeightOffset()](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html#getHeightOffset()))
* The offset is calibrated so that the y-coordinate of the skull minus the default height offset ([getHeightOffset()](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html#getHeightOffset())) is equal to the y-coordinate of the **center** and *not* the downfacing side of the block. So, a block spawned at `(10.5, 60.5, 23.5)` will perfectly align with the grid of the 'normal' blocks.

To spawn the prepared flying block, just construct a new object of a FlyingBlock, and then call [spawn(Location)](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html#spawn(org.bukkit.Location)), and you're done! Then the [onTick()](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html#onTick()) gets then called once every tick. For more information about the methods, please go to the [Javadoc](http://ase34.github.io/flyingblocksapi/javadocs/latest/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/FlyingBlock.html) page.

### Examples

Sample codes are available in the [`de.ase34.flyingblocksapi.commands.examples` package](tree/master/src/main/java/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/commands/examples). Many of the examples are using anonymous or nested classes. Here's a small selection:

* [RisingBlockCommandExecutor.java](src/main/java/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/commands/examples/RisingBlockCommandExecutor.java) - Simple example that spawns a flying block which rises wiht constant velocity in the sky
* [SineWaveBlockCommandExecutor.java](src/main/java/de/ase34/flyingblocksapi/commands/examples/SineWaveBlockCommandExecutor.java) - Complex example code for a flying block moving up and down in a sine-wave-style

To see these examples in-game, use the `/flyingblocks-examples` command. 

### Other notes for the developer

The developer has to take certain precautions when using this plugin:

* Flying blocks get removed during
  * Disablings of *flyingblocksapi* (reloads/stops of the server) in all worlds.
  * [WorldUnloadEvents](http://jd.bukkit.org/dev/apidocs/org/bukkit/event/world/WorldUnloadEvent.html) in the unloaded world.
  * When the last player leaves a world in the now empty world.
  
  To make them persistent, the developer needs to save the blocks (in a file for example) and to respawn them during the opposite events of the above-mentioned (`onEnable()`, WorldLoadEvent, PlayerJoinEvent). 
* The parameter `trackerUpdateInterval` specifies how often the NMS entity tracker sends packets to update the location of the flying block per tick. See [EntityTrackerEntry.java](https://github.com/SpigotMC/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/EntityTrackerEntry.java) of the mc-dev repository. (Important lines: [99](https://github.com/SpigotMC/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/EntityTrackerEntry.java?source=c#L98), [116-129](https://github.com/SpigotMC/mc-dev/blob/master/net/minecraft/server/EntityTrackerEntry.java?source=c#L116-L129)).
  * It does not influence the smoothness of flying blocks with velocities applied. Packets about velocity updates are broadcasted immediately after the onTick() method. However, the tracker still broadcasts packets about the location in the specified interval to prevent desyncs.
  * When teleporting, the updating packet will be sent when the entity tracker triggers. (So, the maximum delay is the value of the tracker-update-interval)
  
  Thus, choose a high tracker-update-interval (5-10) if your movement only relies on velocities, and choose a low one (1-2) if your movement heavily relies on fast location updates. 
* As the technique requires the *Horse* entities, the developer has to check if animal entities won't be instantly killed because of the `spawn-animals` flag set to *false* in the *server.properties* file.
